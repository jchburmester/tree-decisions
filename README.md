# tree-decisions
This repository contains a prototype modeling framework focused on tree growth and carbon deposition in wood, with an emphasis on tree-ring increments and small-scale processes.

## Repository, Code, and Data
The first work will be carried out in the Google Colab Notebook, that can be found in this repository (`TD_data_wrangling.ipynb`). Project datasets will be stored and accessed through Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/me/uploads?q=&f=shared_with_me%3Afalse&l=list&p=1&s=10) to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

## Workflow Overview
The notebook includes scripts for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and prototype sub-model development, with the goal of future integration into a head-model.

## Dependencies and Version Control
Initially, standard Python packages are used. Version control and dependency pinning will evolve depending on the methods applied during analysis and model development. Updates will be documented and managed via the Ã¨nv.yml` file in this repository.
